# Custom Troop Upgrades
 Custom Troops Upgrades - allows troop upgrade paths to be added and removed without having to modify troop XML files.

## Known Issues
 * There is a maximum of 2 upgrades per troop. Any more than that will cause distortions on the troop's encyclopedia page, and accessing the troop's upgrades in the Party view will crash the game. The only known workaroud is to delete an existing upgrade first, then add your upgrade in.
