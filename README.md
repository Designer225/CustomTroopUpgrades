# Custom Troop Upgrades
 Custom Troops Upgrades - allows troop upgrade paths to be added and removed without having to modify troop XML files.

## Known Issues
 * There is a maximum of 2 upgrades per troop. Any more than that will cause distortions on the troop's encyclopedia page, and will cause a game crash when attempting to access that troop's upgrades. The only known workaroud is to delete an existing upgrade first, then add your upgrade in.
